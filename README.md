# Chess-Vision-System
The main task is to detect real-time chess moves, so we tried to detect the board and state of each chess piece to genrate the played moves. 
This repository contains the source code [vision_system_final.py](https://github.com/omarsayed7/Chess-Vision-System/blob/master/vision_system_final.py) , and some of the intermediate processing of the video image.

And this is the sample of the genrated moves based on chess algebraic notation:
